#this is a very stupid makefile that has as only purpose the building of the executable of the unitTests
#it already has all the object compiled by the "father" makefile
#and it exists for those cases when there are needed "additional" objects in the link
#so it just needs to link them and MicroMock and CTest archives in a nice executable.

#the following are variables that come from the "father" makefile: 
#OUTDIR: this is where the output goes. reason: avoid duplication in every makefile
#EXECUTABLE_NAME: this is the executable name to be build. Reason: I don't know how to get easily the folder name.
#UNIT_TEST_LIBRARIES: this is MicroMock and CTest libraries

#this is the place where all the "additional regular" (That is, those who come out of "Common" folder goes)
COMMON_OBJECT_DIR=../../src

#these are the additional objects to be linked. It usually will include the "code under test" object and others.
ADDITIONAL_OBJECT_FILES_TO_BE_LINKED=$(COMMON_OBJECT_DIR)/buffer.o $(COMMON_OBJECT_DIR)/gballoc.o $(COMMON_OBJECT_DIR)/../adapters/lock_pthreads.o

#these are the C object files
OBJECTS_C=$(wildcard ./*.o)

#these are CPP object files
OBJECTS_CPP=$(wildcard ./*.opp)

#the name of the compilation is given by the name of the folder we are in
